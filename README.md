# JSON-java

This repository is a fork of the original [JSON-java](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java) repository by Douglas Crockford.  This repository only adds two files, build.xml and build.properties, which allow for the ant build system to compile this code into a jar file.  The jar file produced by this project is used for JSON parsing in the [GIS Tools for Hadoop](http://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop) and [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](http://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop) projects.

Other JSON library implementations may be found at: [JSON.org](http://www.json.org).
